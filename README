Let us know whether OOMidi works for you !!!

I have ported this codebase to Qt5 and cleaned most of it for c++11 except warnings.
LV2 plugins may still be broken but that's hard for me to fix because I don't have a computer
capable of running OOMidi and supporting cast.
(If anyone wants to donate a 64bit laptop with at least 4Gb RAM that will change linuxras@gmail.com)
